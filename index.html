  <h3 class="p3">Early life</h3>
  <p class="p3">On December 27, 1924, in Gentry County, Missouri, Jean Bartik was born. Jean Bartik's mother's name was Lulu May Spainhower, and she was from Alanthus. Bartik's father was William Smith Jennings, was from Alanthus Grove, and was a farmer and a school teacher. Bartik had five siblings, which were three brothers and two sisters. In 1945 she graduated from Northwest Missouri State Teachers College, majoring in mathematics.</p>
  <h3 class="p3">Career</h3>
  <p class="p3">In 1945, Jean Bartik was hired by the University of Pennsylvania as a maths major. She calculated ballistics trajectories for Army Ordinance. Bartik was required to carry out this work by hand as a human computer. When she applied, she got selected for a project when the Electronic-numeric Integrator and computer for short ENIAC. ENIAC was developed and become one of its first programmers.  When ENIAC was programmed, it was setting dials and changing cable connections. Since there was no manual, Jean Bartik and her five other original programmers gained expertise in programming the ENIAC.
She and a group of programmers worked later to convert the ENIAC to a stored-program computer. Therefore Bartik came up with the BINAC and UNIVAC computers by working with ENIAC designers. However, Bartik resigned in 1951; the same year UNIVAC was introduced.</p>
  <h3 class="p3">Personal Life</h3>
  <p class="p3">While working for Army ordinance at the University of Pennsylvania, Bartik met an engineer working on a Pentagon Project. His name was William Bartik. In 1946 they got married and then later divorced in 1968.
Later Life
Bartik returned to her regular job as a job portfolio in 1967. She becomes an editor for Auerbach publishers. Later on, Jean Bartik was working for a firm named data decisions in 1981 as a senior. Nevertheless, data decisions had to shut down in 1985 because it got acquired by McGraw-Hill. As a result, Bartick lost her and started her career as a real estate agent at age 61.  unfortunately, On March 23, 2011, she passed away from heart failure. </p>
  <h3 class="p3">Significant Awards
</h3>
  <p class="p3">Jean Bartik received many significant awards and other original programmers of the ENIAC; however, the Women in Technology International Hall of Fame introduced Jean Bartik. received a fellowship at the Computer History Museum to convert the ENIAC into a stored-program computer. Jean Bartik had other awards like the IEEE Computer Pioneer Award for her pioneering work regarding the ENIAC and the Korenman Award from the Multinational Center for Development of Women in Technology (MDWIT).</p>

<h3 class="p3">Quote</h3>
<p class="p3">"I was told I'd never make it to VP rank because I was too outspoken. Maybe so, but I think men will always find an excuse for keeping women in their place. So let's make that place the executive suite and start more of our own companies." -Jean Bartik. </p>
